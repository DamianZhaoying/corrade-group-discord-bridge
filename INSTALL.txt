[:- Requirements -:]

* node.js, confirmed working with version 10.15.3 (node -v) and NPM
* a Discord bot & token (search for: creating a discord bot & getting a token)
* Corrade, confirmed working with version 10.2.7056.25255
  * Corrade must have the MQTT server enabled and running.

Two programs will have to be running: Corrade and the bridge program (this 
one), at all times for the messages to be relayed.

Setting up Corrade is wholely documented on the Wizardry and Steamworks Corrade 
page.
Node.JS can be installed for each Linux distribution and for Windows from 
official sources.

[:- Installing -:]

In the directory containing this document issue the command:

npm install

in order to install dependencies.

Next, copy the file "config.yml.dist" to "config.yml" and edit the file to make 
the settings.

[:- Running -:]

For a test run, execute:

node main.js

and follow the console messages. If everything went well, the program will 
announce that it has connected to Discord and to the Corrade MQTT server.

[:- Linux: Running as a Service -:]

Copy the file from "contrib/linux/corrade-group-discord-bridge.service" to 
"/etc/systemd/system/" and edit it to configure parameters.

Set the executable bit on the main file:

chmod +x /etc/systemd/system/corrade-group-discord-bridge.service

Issue the command:

systemctl enable corrade-group-discord-bridge.service

to enable the service.

Finally, issue:

systemctl start corrade-group-discord-bridge.service

to start up the bridge in the background.

The service will be restarted in case it crashes and will also restart after 
reboots.
